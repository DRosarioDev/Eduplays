## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DRosarioDev/Eduplays.git
cd Eduplays
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create a Branch

Use a descriptive name for your branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-fix-bug
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` — new functionality
- `fix/` — bug fixes
- `refactor/` — code improvements without behavior change
- `docs/` — documentation only

### 4. Make Your Changes

- Keep changes focused. One feature or fix per PR.
- Make sure the app builds and lints without errors:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### 5. Commit

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add: memory game with card flip logic"
git commit -m "Fix: timer not resetting on Play Again"
git commit -m "Refactor: extract game logic into custom hook"
```

### 6. Push & Open a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a Pull Request against the `main` branch on GitHub. Include:
- A short description of what you changed and why
- Screenshots or a screen recording if the change affects the UI

```

### Adding a New Game

1. Create `src/pages/YourGame.jsx` — use `Maths.jsx` or `Color.jsx` as a reference.
2. Add a route in `src/App.jsx`:
   ```jsx
   <Route path="/yourgame" element={<YourGame />} />
   ```
3. Add a button for it in `src/pages/Home.jsx`.
4. Reuse the existing components (`StartComponent`, `Timer`, `Score`) as much as possible.

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

- **Style**: follow the existing code style; ESLint is configured and enforced.
- **Components**: keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- **No new dependencies** without discussing it first in an issue. The project intentionally stays lightweight.
- **Accessibility**: new UI elements should be keyboard-navigable and have appropriate labels.
- **Responsive**: test your changes on mobile viewport sizes too. The CSS already has breakpoints at 768px and 480px.
